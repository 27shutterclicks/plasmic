This package is the public-facing Plasmic runtime (presentational style).  It contains functions
and type definitions used by generated blackbox presentational code.

If you want to use this for yourself, then first build the output:

  yarn build

Then create a link to this:

  yarn link

Then, from the package where you want to use this package, do:

  yarn link plasmic-p

This basically symlinks a folder in your consumer node_modules folder that links back
to the output from `yarn build`.  If you update any file here, be sure to run `yarn build`
again so your updates are reflected in consuming packages.
