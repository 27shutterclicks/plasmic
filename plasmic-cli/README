Public plasmic cli for syncing designs to local code.

To use in development, you should first:

  yarn build

Which generates the js file in dist/.  Then, you should do

  yarn link

Which adds the bin file to the yarn global bin (the location of the global bin is
at `yarn global bin`.)

If you see the symlink there but can't execute it, you'll need to set the permission
correctly

  chmod +x `yarn global bin`/plasmic

Usage
=====

`plasmic init` creates the initial plasmic.json file, pointing to your local dev host.

`plasmic sync --projects ...` allows you to sync all components in the specified projects
down as code files to your current folder.  Once you've run `plasmic init`, you can run
`plasmic sync` from any subfolder of the folder with the `plasmic.json` file.
