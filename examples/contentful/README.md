# Contentful + Plasmic example

This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with [`create-plasmic-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-plasmic-app).

To play with the live Plasmic project:

https://studio.plasmic.app/projects/8ibg42QGrW4vGT7WCuKLAF

It includes a couple of code components:

- ContenfulFetcher, which fetches Contenful data (type and schema hard-coded for this app) and repeats some elements
- ContenfulField, which renders a specific text or image field (you pick from a dropdown)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Then open the corresponding Plasmic project (cloning it if you wish):

https://studio.plasmic.app/projects/KvH4HMs91XCoTmeRY5e5v

You can start editing your project in Plasmic Studio.
